      <p>Hi, my name is Nicole Stokowski. I'm currently 17 years old, born on March 1 of the year 2000 and a rising junior at
        El Cerritio High School. I'm the oldest child of three (I have a younger sister and brother) and I am a meltingpot of many
      cultures. </p>
      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>When it comes to sports, figure skating and swimming are my top two. They both are such a huge part of my life and consiquently,
      both strongly influence my strengths and weaknesses. As you might have already guesses, or which seems pretty obvious, is that
      I can swim and glide on ice, but what other strengths can bea attained from these activities other than just those two? Well,
      for starters, physically, I feel stronger and happier with my overall fitness, but also mentally I am stronger because
      both sports test my mental toughness, drive, committment, whatever you want to call it and I have found that these tests and trials
      can applied to any real life situation. So, life lessons and confidence building are a huge part of why I do the activities
      I do and of course there are the people you meet along the way. Let's just say that if I was suddenly forced to stop either
      of these activities I wouldn't know what to do with my "empty" life.</p>
      <h2>School/ Art/ Music (The rest of my life)</h2>
      <p>So, I play sports, great, but I mentioned that I attended El Cerrito High School, and so you might ask "What has your high school
        experience been like thus far?" Well, let me tell you.... High school has actually been pretty great. Yeah, maybe I was that shy freshman who kind
      of disappeared during the first semester because I didn't talk a lot three years ago, but I think that I've come along way in relation to those
      darker days (I may be exagerating a bit here).</p>
